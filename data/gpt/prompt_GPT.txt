A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.

A geodemographics company is trying to explain the characteristics of a neighborhood to a new customer. They present data comparing this neighborhood to the national average. A score of 100 means the neighborhood is equivalent to the national average, a score of 150 means the neighborhhood one and a half times the national average, a score of 200 means the neighborhood is twice the national average, a score of 50 means the neighborhood is half of the national average, a score of 300 means the neighborhood is three times the national average. Their neighborhood has the following charactersitics, described in #DATA# below. Data are presented for each charactersitic followed by a colon, and then a score. The description of the neighborhood should focus on characteristics that have scores which are greater than 120 or less than 80. If 'housing units that are Renter occupied' have scores that are less than 80, then don't describe any details about the rent prices.
