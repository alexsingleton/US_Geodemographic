# US Geodemographic Classification

# Introduction / Aim

This repo presents the code used to build a new geodmeographic classification for the US, following previous work within this geographic [context](https://github.com/geoss/acs_demographic_clusters/).

# Code
The code is organised into a series of files:

* 1_Initial_Variable_Selection - This code pulls a list of variables that might be considered in a new geodemographic within the context of our previous work on the US (https://doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2015.1052335)
* 2_Download_ACS_Data_and_Prep - This code downloads the raw ACS data and creates measures that were used to explore correlations. 
* 3_Correlation_Final_Variable_Selection - This code produces correlation descriptions and attribute summaries.
